# Taqadam
## Project Overview 
#the platform is addressing two major problems that **faces the graduate students here In _Palestine_**,
the first one is that the graduation projects in which they put their knowledge and experience
gained from the university in ends in nowhere to get, the second problem is the unemployment
graduates since they cant reach to companies to demonstrate their projects and ideas, so the main
idea of the platform is to provide a space that connects the students, companies and associations
in one place. The students can share their graduation projects on the platform so that if an
association finds it interesting and special it can adopt the project financially, and if a company
sees the skills and logic needed for its tasks it can contact the project students to offer them a job.
